# Real-Time Face Detection System

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV's DNN (Deep Neural Network) module and a pre-trained Caffe model. It captures video from your webcam, detects faces in each frame, and displays bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## 🧠 Model Details

This project uses a deep learning model based on a ResNet10 SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) architecture.


### Download the required files:

 ```bash
    [deploy.protoxt](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/raw/master/samples/dnn/face_detector/deploy.prototxt)
    
    [res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_3rdparty/raw/dnn_samples_face_detector_20170830/res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000.caffemodel)
 ```

#### Rename or place them in the same folder as:
 ```bash
    `deploy.prototxt`
    `face_model.caffemodel`
 ```

## 🚀 How to Run

 ```bash
    python face_detection.py
 ```

Press `q` to quit the webcam window.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Real-time face detection from webcam

- ✅ Confidence score display

- ✅ Bounding boxes around detected faces

- ✅ Frames-per-second (FPS) calculation

- ✅ Input validation (model file and webcam check)

- ✅ Auto-clamping to prevent frame-bound errors

---


## 📌 Notes

- Works best in well-lit environments.

- Accuracy threshold can be modified from `confidence > 0.5` in the `face_detector.py`.
